This bug occurs when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) in Objective-C.  The issue arises when an observer is not removed properly before the observed object is deallocated. This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.  Specifically, if an object is deallocated while it still has observers registered for its properties, sending messages to the deallocated object's memory will lead to crashes. This is especially problematic in situations where the observer is a strong reference to the observed object, creating a retain cycle.
